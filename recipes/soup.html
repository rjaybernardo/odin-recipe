    I have made this potato soup for many whom have given it this title. It takes a bit of effort but is well worth it. Please note: for those who do not wish to use bacon, substitute 1/4 cup melted butter for the bacon grease and continue with the recipe. (I generally serve this soup as a special treat as it is not recommended for people counting calories.)

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Meat</li>
  <li>Onion</li>
  </li>
  <li>canned Tomatoes</li>
  <li>Fresh Herbs</li>
  <li>Sugar</li>
  <li>Spices and seasoning</li>
  <li>Noodles</li>
  <li>Cheese</li>
  <li>Eggs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>Place bacon in a Dutch oven and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain bacon pieces on paper towels. Drain off all but 1/4 cup of the bacon grease.</li>
    <li>Cook celery and onion in the reserved bacon drippings until onion is soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add cubed potatoes, and toss to coat. Sauté for 3 to 4 minutes. Return bacon to the pan, and add enough chicken stock to just cover the potatoes. Cover, and simmer until potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a separate skillet over medium heat. Whisk in flour. Cook, stirring constantly, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in heavy cream, tarragon, and cilantro.</li>
    <li>Bring cream mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes. Add cream mixture to the potato mixture; stir to combine.</li>
    <li>Transfer about 1/2 of the soup to a blender and purée. Return to the Dutch oven. Adjust seasonings to taste.</li>
    <li>Serve hot and enjoy!
