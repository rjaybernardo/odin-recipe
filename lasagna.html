<p>
  This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
  made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more
  traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's
  recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have
  found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic
  bread.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Meat</li>
  <li>Onion</li>
  </li>
  <li>canned Tomatoes</li>
  <li>Fresh Herbs</li>
  <li>Sugar</li>
  <li>Spices and seasoning</li>
  <li>Noodles</li>
  <li>Cheese</li>
  <li>Eggs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.

    </li>
    <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.

    </li>
    <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
    <li>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

    </li>
    <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</li>
    <li>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.

    </li>
    <li>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
